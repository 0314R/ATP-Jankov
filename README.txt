cpl.pl is Otten's CPL ATP from the tutorial.
ipl.pl is my IPL ATP.

I have manually written 20 test cases into the syntax for my prover in folder ILTP/manual.
The file ILTP/statuses.txt contains the intuitionistic status (Theorem or not) for these test cases.

The script manualTestCases.sh tests all testcases and outputs whether ipl.pl thinks they are Theorems or not,
as well as execution time.
